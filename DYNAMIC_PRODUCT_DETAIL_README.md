## Setup Instructions:

### 1. Run the Test Data Seeder
```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=VendorTestDataSeeder
```

### 2. Access the Page
- Default: `/barbershop` (uses vendor ID 1)
- With specific vendor: `/barbershop/1`

### 3. Model Features Added

#### Vendor Model Enhancements:
- `withFullDetails()` scope - loads all related data
- `getOperatingHours($day)` - gets formatted hours for specific day

#### Component Methods:

- `getStarRating()` - returns star rating breakdown

- **Dynamic review filtering** buttons with actual counts and functional filtering

- **Responsive operating hours** table

## Latest Enhancements (Final Version):

### ‚ú® New Features Added:
1. **Interactive Review Filtering**:
   - Working filter buttons for 5‚≠ê, 4‚≠ê, 3‚≠ê, 2‚≠ê, 1‚≠ê reviews
   - "With Media" filter shows reviews containing photos
   - Dynamic count displays for each filter
   - Visual feedback for active filters

2. **Review Photo Gallery**:
   - Displays up to 3 review photos per review
   - Shows overflow indicator (+N) for additional photos
   - Handles both local storage and external link images
   - Responsive image sizing with proper borders

3. **Enhanced UI/UX**:

- `formatPrice($price)` - Formats prices (60000 ‚Üí "60K")
- `getServiceDuration($price)` - Estimates service duration based on price

## Updated Seeder Logic (Latest Version):

### üì∏ **Enhanced Photo Quality**:
- **Thumbnail Source**: Now uses the **first photo** from `all_photos_urls` instead of `main_thumbnail_url`
- **Reasoning**: The `main_thumbnail_url` from Google Maps is often low-resolution and blurry
- **Quality**: First photo in `all_photos_urls` is typically the highest quality main image
- **Fallback**: If `all_photos_urls` is empty, falls back to `main_thumbnail_url`

### üîÑ **Seeder Changes Made**:
1. **VendorSeeder.php** updated to prioritize first high-quality photo
2. **Photo Management**: Creates thumbnail from best available source
3. **No Duplicates**: Remaining photos exclude the thumbnail to avoid duplication
4. **Robust Handling**: Proper fallback system for edge cases

### üéØ **Photo Quality Improvements**:
- Main vendor images now display in **high resolution**
- Better visual presentation on the product detail page
- Consistent image quality across all vendor profiles
- Optimal user experience with crisp, clear images

### 2. Dynamic Data Loading:
- Check different vendor IDs: `/barbershop/2`, `/barbershop/3`, etc.
